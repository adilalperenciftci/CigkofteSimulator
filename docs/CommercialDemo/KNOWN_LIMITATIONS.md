# Known limitations

Genuine, non-blocking limitations of the current branch. Defects that are simply
not fixed yet belong in `PLAN.md`, not here.

## Dialogue

- The bucket key carries one bit for "the order was correct", so the offline
  line table cannot tell a missing ayran from the wrong spice — both land in the
  same `a0` bucket. Widening the key would multiply the 2400 buckets and
  invalidate the generated table, so it is deliberate. The AI prompt does name
  the specific mistake; only the offline fallback is coarse.
- The seed table covers 21 of 2400 buckets. Everything else falls back to the
  canned mood lines, which is the designed behaviour until the generator is run
  with an API key (see `AI/CigDialogueTable.h`).

## Audio

- The night ambience is the daytime street recording low-passed rather than a
  separate night field recording, because the licensed pack has no night city
  bed. It reads as the same street later in the evening, which is what the layer
  needs, but a real night recording would carry detail a filter cannot invent.
  Sources and edits are in `CREDITS.md`.
- `CarEngine` is mapped to a metal one-shot and `CatMeow` is unmapped. Both are
  documented in `ASSETS.md` rather than disguised with pitch shifting.

## Coverage

- The 52 automation tests cover pure formulas, tables and data integrity. There is
  no end-to-end scenario test yet that opens a day, prepares a wrap, serves a
  customer and asserts the resulting money, reputation and review.

## Platform

- No Steam integration. The platform abstraction in Stage 10 has not started, so
  achievements are local only.

## Content

- Districts unlock by level and are decorated from primitives plus optional Fab
  packs. With no packs installed the outer districts read as stylised blocks.
